My name is Aleksander Zywot. I use data to improve our healthcare system. I'm a medical doctor with surgical training and have a masters in public health where I focused on studying biostatistics.

When I was a junior in highschool I was invited to present my research on fractals and phase space at my local Mensa club and then at the University of Dayton for their annaul mathematics conference.

What else do you need?
